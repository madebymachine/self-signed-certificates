# Anti-code of conduct

This project has no code of conduct. It is, and always shall be, free and
unencumbered from any such politically-correct nonsense. Its maintainers believe
that civilised creatures can, and should, resolve personal grievances amongst
themselves, and that the law has no business in matters of personal conduct.
